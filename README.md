# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

#### V.Isualize has requested a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data per city type, using Python and Pandas. Besides, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type should be added to the analysis, using Pandas and Matplotlib. 
#### The final report summarizes the differences found in the data among the city types and suggests how those difference could be used by PyBer top line executives to make informed decisions.

## Results

+ Urban cities tend to have the lowest average fare per ride and per driver.

+ There are more drivers than rides in urban cities which explains their lowest average fare per driver. 

+ The rides vs. drivers ratio in rural cities is slightly higher than in suburban cities. Rural cities tend to have the lowest quantity of drivers.

+ There is a big gap in the average fare per driver among all the city types, especially between urban cities and rural cities. This metric is more than three times higher in rural cities than urban cities.

+ The three city types show one of their highest peaks in the third week of February. It might be or not related to the same event, but it is very noticeable in the graph below.  

+ Fares in urban cities show more peaks and dips than in other city types, specially in March.

## Summary
Main recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types. 

* Based on the differences on the fare per ride among the city types, it is suggested a more in-depth analysis of the prices, especially in rural cities for them to be as much competitive as possible.   

* To consider some marketing campaings to recruit more drivers in rural cities. 

* To consider sharing driver services between suburban and rural areas when possible, and between urban and suburban cities.

* To conduct marketing campaigns to raise more awareness about PyBer services in rural and suburban cities.
